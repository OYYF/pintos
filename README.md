# Pintos

## Prepare the development environment

1. Install vagrant from its [website](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html). MacOS and linux users can use the package management tool you like.

2. Clone this repository

```
git clone https://github.com/YorkHe/pintos.git
```

3. Go to the root of the repository, then run `vagrant up`. This may take a while. Please do this with good Internet connection.

4. Run `vagrant ssh` to log into the VM. The source code will be placed under the path `/home/vagrant/pintos`, and it is synced with the `pintos` directory in this repository.

5. HAVE FUN!
